			<h2>Easy to assemble. Rock solid.</h2>
			<p>Modulos surface is comprised of Modules - surface tiles each capable
			of being connected to another one in any direction providing you with infinite possibilities.</p>
			<p>We have refined a <strong>super-simple</strong>, yet absolutely stable connection system
			for the modules, which makes assembly a breeze. The only tool you need is a hex key - 
			which is included in your module's box. Simply connect the modules with 
			wooden pins, fasten them together with a simple screw system and 
			you're ready to go! And the desk, of course, 
			<strong>holds weight just as any other desk would!</strong></p>
